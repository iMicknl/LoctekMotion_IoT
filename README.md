## Turn your LoctekMotion/FlexiSpot desk into a smart desk

Recently I acquired a new standing desk from FlexiSpot. During assembly I noticed that the control panel had a RJ45 cable and a second RJ45 port, which sparked my interest. Can we connect my desk to the internet?

Most of the models Flexispot sells are using components from LoctekMotion. [LoctekMotion](https://www.loctekmotion.com/) is a manufacturer of lifting columns for height adjustable standing desks. On their website they mention a [bluetooth receiver](https://www.loctekmotion.com/shop/accessories/bt-desk-app/) that can be inserted to the control box, but I haven't been able to find this.

This repository will help you to connect your desk to the internet via the serial communication ports (RJ45), for example for use with [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). Think of scenarios like controlling your desk via voice or creating notifications when you sit for too long.

## Research

If you are interested in the internals of the LoctecMotion desk system, have a look at the research below which is composed of my own findings combined with findings of [similar projects](#similar-projects--research).

### Control Panels

At the time of writing, LoctekMotion sells [11 different control panels](https://www.loctekmotion.com/product/control-panel/). The features can differ per model, but it looks like the serial interface is pretty similar for the more advanced models.

The tables below will show a mapping of the RJ45 pinout to the pinout used by the control panel. Please note that all RJ45 pins are described in the following way;

![RJ-45 connector layout](images/RJ-45_connector.jpg)

In order to connect the control box to a Raspberry Pi and ESP32/ESP8266 chip I used a [RJ45 to RS232 adapter](https://www.allekabels.nl/rs232-kabel/4568/1041186/rj45-naar-rs232.html) with DuPont cables (jump wires), but you simply can cut and split an ethernet cable as well.

Other control panels / control boxes could be supported in the same way, but you would need to figure the RJ45 pinout mapping. Most control boxes have an extra RJ45 port for serial communication, but otherwise you would need to place your device in between the control panel and the control box.

### Retrieve current height

Based upon the great work of [minifloat](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/493524), it became clear that the control panel utilises a [7-segment display](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven-segment_display). Fortunately, this is very common in such devices and thus there is a lot of [documentation](https://lastminuteengineers.com/seven-segment-arduino-tutorial/) on this topic. 

The control box sends the height as 4-bit hexadecimal, which is decoded in the control panel to drive the 7-segment display. The second number on the display also supports an optional decimal point ("8 segment").

Make sure you set the baud rate to 9600. For most LoctekMotion desks, the control box only broadcasts the current height for x seconds after you sent the Wake Up command. Otherwise you will receive `0x00` `0x00` `0x00` as payload.

- Number entity may overshoot. For more accurate positioning, use the provided presets.

### Execute a command

The control box only accepts commands when the 'screen is active'. To activate the screen, `PIN 20` needs to be set to HIGH for about 1 second. The screen gets disabled automatically again after some amount of time receiving no commands.

#### Command list

| Command name      | Start | Length | Type | Payload   | Checksum  | End  |
| ----------------- | ----- | ------ | ---- | --------- | --------- | ---- |
| Wake Up           | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `00` `00` | `6c` `a1` | `9d` |
| Up                | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `01` `00` | `fc` `a0` | `9d` |
| Down              | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `02` `00` | `0c` `a0` | `9d` |
| M                 | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `20` `00` | `ac` `b8` | `9d` |
| Preset 1          | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `04` `00` | `ac` `a3` | `9d` |
| Preset 2          | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `08` `00` | `ac` `a6` | `9d` |
| Preset 3 (stand)  | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `10` `00` | `ac` `ac` | `9d` |
| Preset 4 (sit)    | `9b`  | `06`   | `02` | `00` `01` | `ac` `60` | `9d` |

All bytes combined will become the command to send to the control box. See the [packages](#packages) for sample code.
